# sudoku-solver
simple C algorithm for solving a Sudoku using a backtrack algorithm

Currently Doesn't validate input and will segfault if a cmdline arg isn't given (i.e. I'm lazy atm, and these issues will be fixed soon)

Input files should be in the format shown in the sample files. You could theoretically make the input file 1 line, just make sure that
it's in left->right, top->bottom order.
